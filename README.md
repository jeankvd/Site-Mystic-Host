## Description
With this website I wanted to test my adaptability regarding Front End Framewroks. I chose the Skeleton Framework (which I've never used before) and set myself to make a clean w3c compliant website from a PSD. I am very satiisfied with the result and will probably create additional pages for the site. 
## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Responsive Design
- Skeleton
- PSD to Website
## Issues

1. The Skeleton framework's Grid is weird, in the sense that rather than reordering the grid on mobile viewports it just keeps the original version and displays it smaller. I had to manually build the responsive grid for this website. 
2. Because the Skeleton framework keeps the large viewport grid and displays it smaller the font was too small to read. While BootStrap would have taken care of this I had to revise the typography for mobile viewports.

## Next Steps
It was fun trying a new framework and the skeleton framework will probably come in handy when creating webapps. But for  now I will stick with the BootStrap framework for most of my next projects.
